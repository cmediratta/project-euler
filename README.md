# Project Euler Solutions

My solutions for Project Euler, a group of CS and mathematics problems outlined on https://projecteuler.net/. I am using these to learn how to write clean and readable python code. All of these solutions will be as general purpose and incorporating as possible, adding methods that solve for more general purpose applications of these problems.

## Format

Every file here has the problem number in the name of the file, and has outlined in each solution the problem that I solved.

## Usage

Each of these tests are python files that are run with

'''
python3 <solution>.py
'''

That's about it, if you really want to run or copy these solutions be my guest but they are not very optimized.
